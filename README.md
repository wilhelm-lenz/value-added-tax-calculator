This is a calculator designed to calculate value-added tax, net amount, and gross amount when shopping in Germany. There are two VAT rates in Germany: 19% and 7% (for certain products). This app enables calculations from net to gross and vice versa.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to approach a project like this, how to plan it, and what challenges the HTML structure can present. It's crucial to proceed in a structured manner and not to use too many wrapping elements. However, these elements sometimes make later design work easier. In this project, I wrote the JavaScript code directly after the HTML, before beginning the design. In future projects, I will make sure to create at least a basic design to have a better overview of the data output via JavaScript. I found this approach personally more manageable.

### Continued development

In the next phase, I will first revise the project in terms of HTML and CSS to solve the bugs that have come to my attention. Additionally, I want to create a better-structured and more semantic HTML. The application will also be built as an app with Netlify, which is why the calculator will likely take up the entire viewport.
